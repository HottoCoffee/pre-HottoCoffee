# HottoCoffee

HottoCoffee is an open-source software (OSS) service designed to manage batches. It provides a simple way to manage batch history by registering batch and execution schedules, execute the batch in your server, and receive execution result as an HTTP request from your server.

## Getting Started

To get started with HottoCoffee, follow these steps:

1. Clone the HottoCoffee repository to your local machine.
2. Start application with `docker compose up`

## How it Works

HottoCoffee is built to help you manage your batch processes in a simple and efficient way. Here's how it works:

1. Register your batch and execution schedule into HottoCoffee. This can be done via the web interface.
2. Once the batch has completed, HottoCoffee will receive an HTTP request from your server to signal that the batch is complete.
3. You can then view the status of your batches and their execution history in the HottoCoffee web interface.
