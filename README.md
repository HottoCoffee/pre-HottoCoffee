## How it Works

HottoCoffee is built to help you manage your batch processes in a simple and efficient way. Here's how it works:

1. Enter your batch and execution schedule into HottoCoffee. This can be done via the web interface or by making a POST request to the HottoCoffee API.
2. HottoCoffee will automatically execute your batch according to the schedule you provided.
3. Once the batch has completed, HottoCoffee will send an HTTP request to your designated endpoint to signal that the batch is complete.
